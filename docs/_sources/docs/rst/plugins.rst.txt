TikzBuilder Plugins

To make it easy to add new shaped to this tool, the individual shapes are
defined in a class with an associated handler that can be dropped into a single
``shapes`` directory. Here is an example program that uses this idea (adapter
from the reference above):

..  literalinclude::    code/test_plugin.py
    :linenos:
    :caption: test_plugins.py

To run this code, we create a ``spahes folder with this ``__init-_.py fole:

..  literalinclude::    code/shapes/__init__.py
    :linenos:
    :caption: shapes/__init__.py

The magic in this file just populated the ``__all__ list with the names of all
files beginning with ``handle_``. Importing this package gives access to all
such files.

The individual shape handlers look like this:

..  literalinclude::    shapes/handle_ALU.py
    
..  literalinclude::    shapes/handle_REG.py

Each of these handlrs imprts the shape clss file. Each such class must
implement the ``draw`` method used to create the actual shape TikZ_ code needed
for that shape. In this example, these methods just display some text.

And the class files for each shape:

..  literalinclude::    shapes/ALu.py

..  literalinclude::    shapes.REG.py

Here is an example of running this code

..  command-output::    python3 test_plugins.py ALU alu
    :cwd:   code

..  command-output::    python3 test_plugins.py REG pc
    :cwd:   code
